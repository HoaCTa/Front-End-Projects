                    <h1> Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1> 
                    <p>I am a Computer Science (CS) major student. It is still new for me to introduce myself in that title because I would never have imagined that I would be brave enough to take CS major. I changed my major to CS and just finished my first coding class with an A last semester. To somebody, changing major is normal, but to me, it is a huge change in my mindset and perception that set a milestone properly the rest of my life. Reading gave me brave to overcome my fears, opened my eyes into a new way of thinking, and more importantly, helped me build up my self-esteem, which is the most important factor to success. </p>

                    <p>
                        As a person who overcome fears and self-degradation, now I believe that I am fully capable of doing anything, not just computing itself. I think that people have their own fears. These self-create-fears make them doubt about their competence and stop them from achieving their dreams. People should stop being afraid and stop having negative thoughts so that they can gradually build their strong self-confidence, which helps them increase the chances of their success and can really see the world full of potentials.                     </p>
