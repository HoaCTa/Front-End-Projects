# Front-End-Projects


## Titles and internal titles
Personal website.

## Introduction
This is my first project ever. I made it during my winter break. It is a clone project from Youtube and I added responsive figure into it to make its outline apllicable on smaller screen, example on your personal phones or tablets.


I created this project to practice what I have learned during the break and also want to know steps to create a personal website

## Technologies
HTML, CSS.

## Launch
It can run on any web browers, but for a complete display, use Google Chrome.
