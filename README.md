# Project Name
My personal website



## Description
This is my first web development project. I created it during my winter break in 2020 for fun because I learned some web development skills on YouTube, and I wanted to practice what I had learned. I added responsive features to the website to make it accessible and user-friendly on a variety of devices.



## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JS

## Launch
It can run on any web browser, but for the best display, use Google Chrome.
